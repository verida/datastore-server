# Welcome to Verida Datastore Server

This server acts as middleware between web applications built using the [Verida Datastore](http://www.github.com/verida/datastore) and the underlying databases storing user data.

Key features:

- Ensure all API requests come from verified on chain users (via user signed messages)
- Manage database users, linking them to valid on chain DID's
- Manage permissions for individual databases
- Add a second layer of security by managing per-database ACL validation rules
- Providing applications with user's database DSN's (including user credentials)
